I have developed a Sorting Visualizer to demonstrate realtime working of four Sorting Algorithms i.e Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Bubble Sort. This project is built
using react js and the whole logic is pure JavaScript code. The animation itself is made done using simple JavaScript and no external Library is used during the development of the
project.
